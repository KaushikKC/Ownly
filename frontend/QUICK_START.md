# Ownly - Quick Start Guide

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Environment Setup

Run the setup script to create your environment file:

```bash
npm run setup
```

This creates a `.env.local` file with all required environment variables.

### 2. Required Environment Variables

**CRITICAL**: You must set up these environment variables for the app to work:

#### WalletConnect Project ID (REQUIRED)
- Go to [WalletConnect Cloud](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/)
- Create a new project
- Copy the Project ID to `NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID`

#### Google OAuth (REQUIRED)
- Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
- Create OAuth 2.0 credentials
- Add redirect URI: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google`
- Copy Client ID and Secret to your `.env.local`

#### NextAuth Secret
Generate a random secret:
```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

### 3. Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

## üîß Troubleshooting
