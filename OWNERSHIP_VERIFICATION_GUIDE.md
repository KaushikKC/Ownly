## 🔧 **Current Implementation:**

### **Mock Ownership Verification**
Currently using mock data for ownership verification:
```javascript
// In youtubeService.js
return {
  channelId: channelId,
  email: "mock@example.com", // Mock email
  isVerified: true,
  title: "Mock Channel",
  description: "Mock channel description",
};
```

### **For Production:**
To implement real ownership verification, you need:
1. **YouTube OAuth**: Get user's YouTube channel access
2. **Channel API**: Fetch actual channel owner email
3. **Email Matching**: Compare with user's Google email

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior:**

### **When You Paste a YouTube URL:**
1. **Video Data**: Real title, channel, views, etc.
2. **Ownership Check**: Compares your Google email with channel owner
3. **Status Display**: 
   - ✅ "You are the owner of this channel. You can register this video as IP."
   - ❌ "You are not the owner of this channel. Only the channel owner can register this video as IP."
4. **Button Control**: Only allows proceeding if you're the owner
